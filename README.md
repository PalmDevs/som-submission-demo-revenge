## ‚ùì What does the release contain?

The release contains a prebuilt version of Revenge. A patched Discord Android (293.6 Alpha) build.

It is patched via LSPatch with a custom version of [RevengeXposed](https://github.com/revenge-mod/revenge-xposed) that only executes a bundled-in `revenge.bundle` file.  
This means no extra network requests (and no remote code execution).

### ü§î Is this... safe?

Yes, but if you don't trust me, simply follow the [install instructions](https://github.com/revenge-mod/revenge-bundle-next?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-download) here to get Revenge Next working by yourself.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers

- The build only contains [my own plugins](https://github.com/PalmDevs/revenge-next-plugins). Revenge Next is in its very early stages, and external plugins aren't supported yet. I hope you understand why it is so limited at the moment.
- Some plugins are a work-in-progress and may not work as expected.
- This is a client modification, which is against Discord's Terms of Service, but Discord themselves act indifferently on modified clients, and there are no known cases of people being banned for this.
- This repository is not affiliated with the Revenge organization. The Revenge team will never release anything like this.
